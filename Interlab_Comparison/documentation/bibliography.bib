abstract = {The first 12 years (1974–1985) of continuous atmospheric CO2 measurements from the NOAA GMCC program at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii are analyzed. Hourly and daily variations in the concentration of CO2 due to local sources and sinks are described, with subsequent selection of data representing background concentrations. A digital filtering technique using the fast Fourier transform and low-pass filters was used to smooth the selected data and to separate the seasonal cycle from the long-term increase in CO2. The amplitude of the seasonal cycle was found to be increasing at a rate of 0.05±0.02 ppm yr−1. The average growth rate of CO2 was 1.42±0.02 ppm yr−1, and the fraction of CO2 remaining in the atmosphere from fossil fuel combustion was 59\%. A comparison between the Mauna Loa continuous CO2 data and the CO2 flask sample data from the sea level site at Cape Kumukahi, Hawaii, showed that the amplitude of the seasonal cycle at Cape Kumukahi was 23\% larger than at Mauna Loa, with the phase of the cycle at Mauna Loa lagging the cycle at Cape Kumukahi by about 1–2 weeks.},

abstractNote = {Recent measurementsof the C/sup 14/ specific activity of the atmosphere of the southern hemisphere show that the C/sup 14/ specific activity has lobeen increasing at an approximately exponential rate since late 1954. The total increase by December 1957 was 9.30 plus or minus 0.30% The C/sup 14/ specific activity of the contemporary portion of the biosphere was shown to he increasing at the same rate. The only feasible explanation for this increase in C/sup 14/ specific activity is the production of C/sup 14/ from the testing of atomic weapons. An increase of 2.0 plus or minus 0.5% in the C/sup 14/ specific activity of the surface water of the ocean was observed by December 1957. An exchange time of 3 years for transfer of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the surface water of the ocean is indicated by the above measurements. The C/sup 14/ specific activity of fourteen samples of surface ocean water was determined. The results show a fairly uniform activity for regions where no upwelling of deep water occurs. The C/sup 14/ ages for two ocean profiles were determined as well as two samples from Antarctic deep water. The results indicate a much greater C/ sup 14/ age for South Pacific and Antarctic water than that reported for Atlantic water. (auth)},

abstract="Gas counting is a mature and powerful technique central to radiocarbon dating. The method was taken from the detection techniques used in nuclear physics and adapted to the special requirements of low-level counting of the carbon gases. A compilation made by W G Mook in 1983 lists 174 gas counters used in 14C dating, the counting gases being CO2 (115 counters), CH4 (38), C2H2 (20) and C2H6 (1). In the present contribution, the current status of CO2 gas counting is reviewed. The emphasis on CO2 is justified by several observations: 1) CO2 is the primary gas to be produced in all methods; 2) routine techniques are able to achieve high purity CO2 gas, so further conversion to hydrocarbons appears unwarranted; 3) the cryogenic properties of CO2 facilitates handling and thus minimizes contamination; 4) all gas counting laboratories involved in high-precision work, eg, for calibration, use CO2 as counting gas. Most of the techniques mentioned in this review were already available around 1975 (see the Proceedings of the Ninth International Radiocarbon Conference (Berger {\&} Suess 1979)); since that time, gas proportional counting has become a routine operating technique in several laboratories. Wherever possible, reference is made to individual laboratories; however, as the more technical aspects of the technique that are central to this chapter are rarely fully documented in the literature, we take most examples from the Heidelberg laboratory, and are fully aware that this description gives heavy weight to a single installation.",
