\section{Introduction}
This is currently going to be a running to do 
\begin{itemize}
	\item add summary table in methods summarizing all the institutes, their full names, types of analysis and other information. this could be part of the larger results table as well. `
	\item Address the flaring out of data in Heidelberg comparison around 1994 and 2006, this is due to the data already starting to drift in the direction of higher noise. This is the reason why I actually didn't use 1995 and 2005 but actually extended the boundaries of the record by one year on each side. 
	\item Try to explain the lower values in RRL NWT3 and NWT4 data around 2016-2017
\end{itemize}
