This analysis focuses on investigating long-term systematic biases between the RRL Wellington record and the Heidelberg University CGO record, and ignores seasonality further explored in previous works~\cite{turnbull2017}. The CCGCRV curve-fitting algorithm allows the data to be removed of noise and seasonality, using the "getSmooth" and "getTrend" functions. These functions fit the data with polynomial+harmonic, and polynomial terms only, respectively. The results of the CCGCRV curve fitting algorithm are shown in Figure \ref{fig:results1} for time intervals 1987 - 1991, 1991 - 1994, 2006 - 2009, 2012 - 2016. Semi-transparent data is overlaid with the fits, which are the mean of output from the Monte Carlo simulation. The difference of each mean (14CO2 BHD - CGO) is recorded and the average for each interval deposited into Figure\ref{fig:resulttable}. Uncertainties are the 1-$\sigma$ error around the mean.

\subsubsection{CCGCRV Smooth vs. Trend}
${\Delta\Delta^{14}C}$ values using the CCGCRV "smooth" and "trend" algorithm are the same within error for every case. Complete removal of seasonality results in a more clear visualization of an offset between Wellington and CGO records, further explored in section \ref{WellingtonvCGO}. In the first two time-intervals, paired t-tests show Wellington and CGO statistically different in all cases. In later years, when the observed offset decreases, the variability from seasonality in the "smoothed" data results in a "not different" result while the "trended" data is still different".

\subsubsection{Wellington vs CGO}
\label{WellingtonvCGO}
In the period between 1987 and 1994, RRL measurements are  greater than 1.7\textperthousand higher than Heidelberg University (see Figure \ref{fig:results1}), and statistically different according to paired t-tests (p-value <0.01). 
There is a step-decrease in the offset in the following intervals: DeltaDelta14C is $-0.54\pm0.21$ to $0.58\pm0.26$, within error of the intercomparability goals reestablished by the WMO and GGMT in 2020. Despite being within-error of the intercomparability goal, the data are still statistically different according to paired t-tests. 
The step change in offset between 1987-1991 and 2006-2009/2012-2016 happens in parallel to a significant shift in RRL workflow, namely the inclusion of a 12C cup in the EN Tandem facility at GNS Science, allowing online 13C correction. This dramatically decreased measurement noise \cite{turnbull2017}.
As changes in RRL resulted in decreased measurement noise and better intercomparability, while systems at Heidelberg University remained constant; this points to the possibility that the Wellington record in the early period is offset too high leading to the systematic bias during that time (ugly sentence, fix later). 


\subsection{SIO / LLNL}

  \caption{Top panel shows ${\Delta^{14}CO_{2}}$ measurements of NWT3 standard from RRL and SIO/LLNL, from left to right. Results for NWT4 ${\Delta^{14}CO_{2}}$ measurements are shown similarly on the bottom panel. The faint dotted lines indicate the 1-sigma error range for either standard measured at INSTAAR from 2009-2012}
  \label{fig:siollnl}
\end{figure}

The Niwot Ridge standard materials include one cylinder of ambient air collected from Niwot Ridge, Colorado, USA in 2009 (NWT3) and a second cylinder spiked with some 14C-free CO2. Figure \ref{fig:siollnl} shows ${\Delta^{14}CO_{2}}$ measurements of each material made at RRL and LLNL, in the left and right columns, respectively. A summary of means and standard deviations of each institute's available data for NWT3 and NWT4 is provided in Figure \ref{fig:nwt_results_table}.
While RRL measurements are slightly higher than both INSTAAR ~\cite{lehman2013allocation} and SIO/LLNL, all three datasets are within $1-\sigma$ error of each other. Although they are within error, t-tests show that RRL and SIO/LLNL are statistically offset.

%. The mean and $1-\sigma$ error of each dataset is indicated by the black bar and horizontal box. For NWT3 and NWT4 standards, RRL measurements average $2.72\pm1.14$\textperthousand and $2.44\pm0.75$\textperthousand higher than SIO/LLNL. While means are within $1-\sigma$ error of each other, independent t-tests show the data are statistically different. 
%These data can be challenging to interpret as a true baseline for institutional intercomparability beacuse the avaialble datasets do not overlap in time (RRL: 2013-2020; SIO/LLNL: March-April 2009) and are of significantly different lenght (RRL: n=88; SIO/LLNL: n=9).
